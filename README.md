Project 9, build a Music-release site, made during my Technigo Bootcamp fall 2019.


## 1. What is this?
This is a music release site made with react and using a downloaded response from the Spotify API.

## 2. What did I do?
The focus of this project was to make a 'New Releases' music site using a downloaded response from the Spotify API. I then used this data to build React components which is showing albums and single realeases. I iterated the diffrent data from the downloaded response using map() and this is also the first time I was introduced to the state Hook useState. We needed to follow a design layout, so most of my time I spent building the component, and understanding how to mount different component into the App,js file. 
If I would have more time, I would try to use svg, instead of png, and making them into components when applying the heart, play and dots icons.. I also need to itirate over all the artits, since a few of the albums have more than one artist.
